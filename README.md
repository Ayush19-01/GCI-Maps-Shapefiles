# GCI-Maps-Shapefiles
## How it works:

The program is a menu driven program, it gives the user a choice out of 5 cities to get a map from.

Select a city, wait for some time and you will get a map made out of shapefiles downloaded from the internet.

## Legend to the Maps:

Nature = Green

Used Land = Yellow

Buildings = Brown

Roads = Grey

Railways = Red
